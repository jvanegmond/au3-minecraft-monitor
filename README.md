========================

Server monitor and remote management application for Minecraft written in AutoIt3. This was originally written in Februari of 2011. I'm not sure if it still works, but it will be a great starting point for anyone attempting a similar project so I want to keep it available.

Here's the original description:

The Minecraft server monitor for Windows is installed along side Minecraft and enables:

  * A remote interface which can be connected to via telnet
  * Period backups of the game world (issues a save-all command, waits for it to finish, then does the backup)
  * Open-sourced for commercial and non-commercial work. Allows derivative works.

The tool is written with complete transparency for the game - If the game is ever updated, your monitor will continue to work without changes. This only works on Windows.

*A great tool for Linux* can be found at [http://www.minecraftmonitor.com/ minecraftmonitor.com]
