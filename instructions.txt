You MUST be running the minecraft_server.jar or a similar server for this server to work. It will NOT work with the GUI version.

Instructions:
1. Place minecraftmonitor.exe and minecraftmonitor.ini in the same folder as your minecraft_server.jar
2. Edit minecraftmonitor.ini with a text editor. Use the example values as a guide. Make sure to change the remote password!
3. Start minecraftmonitor.exe as you would normally start your Minecraft server. minecraftmonitor.exe will automatically run your server.
